Distributed Order Execution Engine

A high-performance, asynchronous backend system for executing crypto orders on Solana. It features a microservices architecture using Fastify, BullMQ (Redis), and WebSockets to handle concurrent orders with real-time status updates.

-----

Features

  - DEX Aggregation: Automatically routes orders to the best price between Raydium and Meteora (Mock Implementation).
  - Asynchronous Processing: Uses a persistent Redis queue (BullMQ) to handle high concurrency without blocking the API.
  - Real-time Updates: Pushes live order status (PENDING -\> ROUTING -\> CONFIRMED) to clients via WebSockets.
  - Resilience: Implements exponential back-off and retry logic for failed swaps.
  - Scalability: The "Worker" service can be scaled horizontally to handle thousands of orders per minute.

-----

Architecture

The system follows a Producer-Consumer pattern to ensure scalability and responsiveness.

1.  Producer (API Service): Accepts HTTP POST requests, validates input, and pushes a job to the Redis Queue. Returns an orderId immediately (Non-blocking).
2.  Queue (Redis): Stores jobs persistently, ensuring no orders are lost even if the server crashes.
3.  Consumer (Worker Service): Pulls jobs, queries the Mock DEX Router for quotes, selects the best price, and simulates execution.
4.  WebSocket Service: Listens for events from the Worker and broadcasts real-time updates to the specific client connected to that orderId.

Tech Stack

  - Language: Node.js (v20) + TypeScript
  - Server: Fastify (Chosen for low overhead and built-in WebSocket support)
  - Queue: BullMQ + Redis (Dockerized)
  - Database: PostgreSQL (Dockerized) for order history
  - Testing: Jest (Unit & Integration tests)

Setup & Installation

Prerequisites

  - Node.js (v18+)
  - Docker & Docker Compose

<!-- end list -->

1.  Clone & Install
    git clone [https://github.com/ramcharan999/EternaProject.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/ramcharan999/EternaProject.git)
    cd EternaProject
    npm install

2.  Start Infrastructure
    Start the Redis and PostgreSQL containers using Docker Compose:
    docker-compose up -d

3.  Run the Server
    Start the development server with hot-reloading:
    npm run dev

    (Server will start at http://localhost:3000)

-----

Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using Jest to verify routing logic, queue behavior, and API validation.

Run Unit Tests
npm test

  - Coverage: 10 Tests covering Router logic, API validation, and WebSocket lifecycle.
  - Note: Tests use a real Redis connection (via Docker) to ensure accurate integration testing.

API Documentation

1.  Submit Order (HTTP)
    Queues a new market order for execution.

      - Endpoint: POST /api/orders
      - Body:
        {
        "inputToken": "SOL",
        "outputToken": "USDC",
        "amount": 10
        }
      - Response (201 Created):
        {
        "message": "Order queued successfully",
        "orderId": "d290f1ee-6c54-4b01-90e6-d701748f0851"
        }

2.  Live Updates (WebSocket)
    Listen for real-time status changes for a specific order.

      - URL: ws://localhost:3000/ws/orders/:orderId
      - Events Stream:
        1.  "status": "ROUTING" - Comparing DEX prices.
        2.  "status": "ROUTING\_COMPLETE" - Best route selected.
        3.  "status": "CONFIRMED" - Transaction successful (includes txHash).

Design Decisions

Why Market Orders?
I chose to implement Market Orders to focus on optimizing the latency and throughput of the routing engine. Limit orders would require an additional internal order book and matching engine, whereas Market orders allow us to demonstrate the core value proposition: finding the best immediate price across fragmented liquidity sources.

Why Mock Router?
A Mock Implementation was chosen to focus on architecture and flow.

  - Latency Simulation: Added artificial delays (15s for demo purposes) to mimic blockchain confirmation times and allow easy observation of WebSocket states.
  - Price Variance: Simulated realistic slippage between Raydium and Meteora to test the routing logic's ability to pick the best price.
